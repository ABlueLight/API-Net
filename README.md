# Introduction
This repo contains the source code of API-Net. In order to effectively identify contrastive clues among highly-confused categories, we propose a simple but effective Attentive Pairwise Interaction Network (API-Net), which can progressively recognize a pair of fine-grained images by interaction. We aim at learning a mutual vector first to capture semantic differences in the input pair and then comparing this mutual vector with individual vectors to highlight their semantic differences respectively. Besides, to promote the discriminative ability of features, we introduce a score-ranking regularization to priorities of these features. More details can be found
